# Graph topologies 

To study the effects of different storage structures for the "topology of graphs"

### The following structures are being implemented :
- Compressed Sparse Row
- Blocked Adjacency List
- P-CSR
- Blocked Adjacency List with Packed Memory Arrays

### Following functions are studied : 
- Insertion 
- k-hops (BFS traversal)
